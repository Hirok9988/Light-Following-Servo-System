# Light-Following Servo System using Arduino

This project demonstrates a light-following system using Arduino, LDR sensors, a servo motor, LEDs, and a buzzer.

## Components Used
- Arduino Uno
- LDR Sensors (2)
- Servo Motor
- LEDs (Red, Green, Yellow)
- Buzzer
- Resistors
- Breadboard & Jumper Wires

## Working Principle
Two LDR sensors detect light intensity from different directions. The Arduino compares the analog values and rotates the servo motor toward the direction with higher light intensity. LEDs indicate system status, and a buzzer provides audio feedback during active tracking.

## Applications
- Solar tracking systems
- Automation projects
- Robotics
- Smart energy systems

## Folder Structure
- arduino_code
- connections/ → Wiring / circuit diagram
